## 👨🏻‍🏫 Introduction
Pixel Desktop Pictures is a macOS-exclusive Menu Bar app designed to enhance your desktop experience with stunning wallpapers from Unsplash. The app is structured around four main tabs: Preview, Recents, Collections, and Settings, each serving a specific purpose with a clear separation of concerns.

**Terminologies:** The following terminologies are used to match the design requirements of the Mac operating system. We don't say wallpaper in the context of Macs. The same applies to spaces, and We don't call them desktops like on operating systems like MS Windows.
- Show on all spaces = Show wallpaper on all desktops
- Desktop Picture = Desktop Wallpaper

I know you’d prefer seeing the app in action over reading a wall of text—so I’ve included GIF previews for your convenience. 😉

## 📹 Previews 

# `MAIN` Tab 🖼️
### General Description:

The Main tab lets you explore and set beautiful desktop wallpapers tailored to your preferences. You can refresh images based on your selected collections, set a new image as your desktop wallpaper, or download it in the highest available quality directly to your Mac.

**The Basic Functionalities of the App:**

### Technical Details:

The Main tab leverages Unsplash’s API to fetch and display high-quality images. Depending on your configuration, it retrieves images via two API endpoints:

**1. Random Image Endpoint:**
This endpoint fetches a single random image, ideal for variety and surprise.

**URL:**
`https://api.unsplash.com/photos/random?orientation=landscape`
- **Orientation** is set to `landscape` to ensure compatibility with macOS desktop wallpapers.
- The app doesn’t include additional parameters at this time to keep the implementation simple and focused.

**Decoded Attributes:**

- **Image URLs:** Available in three resolutions—Full, Regular (1080px width), and Small (400px width).
  - **Full:** Used for setting desktop wallpapers to ensure maximum quality.
  - **Regular:** Used for image previews in the Main tab.
  - **Small:** Used for previews in the Recents and Collections tabs.

- **User Information:** Includes the author’s name and a link to the image on Unsplash.
- **Image Location:** Displays the location where the photo was taken (if provided).
- **Download Link:** Ensures accurate download counts on Unsplash, supporting the image author.

> [!Note]
> The app uses Unsplash's dedicated download URL instead of the full resolution URL for downloading. This contributes to the photographer's download count on Unsplash, which supports their work.

**2. Query Image Endpoint:**
This endpoint fetches images based on specific search terms, such as Nature.

**URL Example:**
`https://api.unsplash.com/search/photos?orientation=landscape&page=1&per_page=10&query=Nature`

  - **Query Parameter:** Dynamically takes the name of a selected collection to fetch relevant images.
  - **Pagination:** Images are fetched in batches of 10. The page parameter increments to retrieve additional results.

**Key Differences from the Random Endpoint:**

- **Image Location**: Not included in the response for query-based searches.
- Other attributes, such as image URLs and user information, are consistent.

### Persistence:
All fetched images are stored locally on the Mac using `SwiftData` for efficient and persistent access.

### Placeholder Handling:
Instead of pre-downloading thumbnail images for placeholders, the app displays a random **mesh gradient** view as a placeholder while the high-resolution image is being downloaded. This approach avoids unnecessary complexity while maintaining a smooth user experience.

> **Why not use thumbnails?**
> 
> Downloading thumbnails could improve user experience by providing a quicker preview. However, this would increase app complexity for a relatively simple requirement. The chosen solution balances functionality and simplicity effectively.

### User Experience:
- Refreshing the image triggers a smooth fade animation for a seamless transition.
- Users can click the author’s name in the bottom-left corner to view the original image on the Unsplash website.
- Images can be downloaded directly to the Mac’s **Downloads** folder in the highest available resolution, contributing to the author’s download count on Unsplash.
